# Improving models for predicting trading volume on the Russian stock market

This study is devoted to modeling and improving models for forecasting intraday time series of trading volumes on the Moscow Stock Exchange. The forecasting methods used are the upgraded PC-VWAP, as well as machine learning models: LSTM, XGBoost and Random Forest.

The empirical results of the study lead to the following conclusions: the classical methods of forecasting time series proposed in the article by [1], can be significantly improved using ensemble methods and careful selection of hyperparameters
